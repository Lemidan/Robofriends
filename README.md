# Contact viewer built in React.js.

My first project using React, made with help from a tutorial made by @aneagoie.

Good exercise to getting used to JSX, components, states and referencing.

Deployed it to GitHub Pages using this [tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/tree/master).

Source folder is stored in Master branch, and the build folder is in the gh-pages branch.
